LOGIN PORTAL CONFIGURATION GUIDE
================================

This login portal routes publishers to their individual dashboards.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Publisher logs in with email/password
2. System looks up their credentials in dashboard.json
3. Redirects to their dashboard with filter applied
4. They see only their data

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
===================

STEP 1: Update Dashboard URLs
------------------------------
Open dashboard.json and replace:

- YOUR_PUBLISHER_DASHBOARD_EMBED_URL 
  → Your actual Publisher Dashboard embed URL (5 places)
  
- YOUR_OWNER_DASHBOARD_EMBED_URL
  → Your actual Owner Dashboard embed URL (1 place)

IMPORTANT: Keep the ?params=... part for publisher dashboards!

STEP 2: Update Credentials
---------------------------
For each publisher, update:
- Email address
- Password (use secure passwords!)
- Publisher name
- Domain (must match exactly what's in your Google Sheet)

STEP 3: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
-----------------------------------
1. Go to pages.cloudflare.com
2. Create new project
3. Choose "Direct Upload"
4. Upload all 3 files (index.html, login.js, dashboard.json)
5. Deploy!
6. Your portal URL: yourcompany.pages.dev

STEP 4: Test
------------
1. Visit your portal URL
2. Login with one publisher credential
3. Verify correct data shows
4. Test owner login
5. Verify all publishers visible

STEP 5: Share
-------------
Send each publisher:
- Portal URL: https://yourcompany.pages.dev
- Their email address
- Their password

ADDING NEW PUBLISHERS:
======================

To add a new publisher, add this to dashboard.json:

{
  "newpublisher@example.com": {
    "password": "secure_password",
    "publisherName": "New Publisher Name",
    "domain": "newpublisher.com",
    "dashboard": "YOUR_PUBLISHER_DASHBOARD_URL?params=%7B%22df3%22:%22include%25EE%2580%25800%25EE%2580%2580IN%25EE%2580%2580newpublisher.com%22%7D",
    "dashboardType": "publisher"
  }
}

Make sure the domain in the URL matches EXACTLY what's in your Google Sheet!

SECURITY NOTES:
===============
- Use strong passwords for each publisher
- Change all passwords from the demo ones (demo2024, admin2024)
- Portal files are public - credentials are in JSON (not ideal for production)
- For production systems, consider backend authentication
